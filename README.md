### Stellar Evolution using MESA

Follow one binary star with the stellar evolution code MESA  from ZAMS to core carbon burning of the first star, and comment on the evolution. 
Evolve a population of stars using MESA and compute the distribution of the properties (mass, spin, etc) of the compact object remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes).
